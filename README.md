# Exoplanet hunting in deep space
A neural network trained on the Kepler labelled time series data.

###### Dataset
Datasets are from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/keplersmachines/kepler-labelled-time-series-data)

Determines if a star has at least one exoplanet in orbit based on its change in flux (aka light intensity)

###### Accuracy
Accuracy: 0.9912280701754386
whereas if the model were to guess 0 (no exoplanet) every time the accuracy would be: 0.991150442477876
